# Vier op een Rij - Connect Four Game

## Overview

A simple Connect Four game where a player competes against an AI opponent. The game includes difficulty selection, gameplay, and a high scores feature.

## Technology Stack

- Laravel 12.x with Blade templates
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and AI
- Vanilla CSS for styling
- MariaDB for storing high scores

## Features

### 1. No Authentication Required

The app is publicly accessible without login or registration.

### 2. Home Page / Game Board

- Display a 7x6 grid (7 columns, 6 rows) for the Connect Four board
- Player uses red discs, AI uses yellow discs
- Click on a column to drop a disc
- Visual indication of whose turn it is
- Game state tracking (in progress, player won, AI won, draw)

### 3. Difficulty Selection

Before starting a game, player chooses difficulty:

- **EASY**: AI plays optimal move 66% of the time, random move 33%
- **MEDIUM**: AI plays optimal move 90% of the time, random move 10%
- **HARD**: AI plays optimal move 100% of the time

### 4. AI Opponent

Implemented entirely in JavaScript:

- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move calculation
- Based on difficulty, sometimes chooses a random valid move instead
- AI responds after player moves (with small delay for UX)

### 5. Win Detection

- Check for 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- Highlight winning discs when game ends
- Display win/lose/draw message

### 6. High Score Submission (on win only)

When the player wins:

- Show a form to enter their name
- Record the number of turns it took to win
- Record the difficulty level
- Submit via POST to Laravel backend
- Store in `high_scores` database table

### 7. High Scores Page

A separate tab/page showing:

- List of high scores sorted by fewest turns (ascending)
- Columns: Rank, Name, Turns, Difficulty, Date
- Filter by difficulty (optional)

## Database Schema

## Routes

- `GET /` - Home page with game board
- `POST /scores` - Submit a new high score

## UI/UX Requirements

- Responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)
- Clear visual feedback for disc drops (animation)
- Distinct colors for player (red) and AI (yellow)
- Tab navigation between Game and High Scores

## Game Rules

1. Player always goes first
2. Discs fall to the lowest available position in a column
3. First to connect 4 discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins
4. If board fills up with no winner, it's a draw
5. Only wins are recorded in high scores (not losses or draws)
