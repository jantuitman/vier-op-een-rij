# Claude Progress Report - Coding Agent Session 1

## Session Summary

Successfully bootstrapped Laravel 12.x project and implemented the database foundation (Features 1-2).

## Completed This Session

### ✅ Installation & Setup
- Installed Laravel 12.x framework
- Configured MariaDB database connection (host: mariadb, db: vier_op_een_rij)
- Set up git repository with initial commit

### ✅ Feature 1: Database Migration (PASSING)
- Created `create_high_scores_table` migration
- Schema includes:
  * `id` - bigint primary key with auto-increment
  * `name` - varchar(100), NOT NULL
  * `turns` - unsigned integer
  * `difficulty` - varchar(10)
  * `created_at`, `updated_at` - timestamps
- Migration ran successfully

### ✅ Feature 2: HighScore Model (PASSING)
- Created `HighScore` model in `app/Models/`
- Configured fillable fields: `name`, `turns`, `difficulty`
- Model uses standard Eloquent conventions

### ✅ Test Suite (12 tests, all passing)
Created comprehensive test file `tests/Feature/HighScoreTest.php`:
1. ✓ High_scores table exists
2. ✓ ID column exists as bigint primary key
3. ✓ Name column exists as varchar(100)
4. ✓ Turns column exists as integer
5. ✓ Difficulty column exists as varchar(10)
6. ✓ Timestamp columns exist
7. ✓ HighScore model exists
8. ✓ Fillable fields include name, turns, difficulty
9. ✓ Model can be created with valid data
10. ✓ Validation rejects empty name (NULL constraint)
11. ✓ Validation accepts positive turns
12. ✓ Model accepts valid difficulty values (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD)

## Progress Status

2. **Set up frontend assets** - Install npm dependencies, set up Vite
3. **Create game UI** - Blade template with 7x6 grid
4. **Add StimulusJS** - For game interactivity
